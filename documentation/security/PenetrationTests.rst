Penetration Tests
=================
The GlobaLeaks Project is periodically subject to independent security audit and penetration tests in order to verify and improve the security of the system.

Thanks to our funders and users GlobaLeaks received already 6 independent penetration tests here available. Many others, during the years, have been performed by some private adopters.

We additionally invite independent security researchers to apply to our `Bug Bounty <https://hackerone.com/globaleaks>`_ initiative, which it's hosted on `HackerOne <https://hackerone.com/globaleaks>`_.

These are the detailed reports of penetration tests we've received, along with the transparent feedback and fixing done in response:
